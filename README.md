# YOLO-algorithm-impementation
Yolo algorithm stands for 'You Only Look at Once'
This is  object detection algorithm from any videos, images, and real life camera footages.
This algorithm is used to detect multiple objects or persons or animals at the same time.
Here I implement the code for both already trained yolo model for detect object from any photos or videos.
And also a self training and validating code for a custom data set.
